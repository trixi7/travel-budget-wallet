# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

======

I had this idea for a travel budget wallet because when I was traveling abroad, it was a real hassle to keep track of and separate my “real” money and “travel” money. I thought it would be great to have an app that automatically converts my purchases into PHP, so I can easily see how much of my budget I have left. 

Even though they say you should never convert currencies while traveling, but I’m the type of person who loves to keep everything organized, especially my finances. BUT I still dream of the day when I won’t need this app anymore because I’ll be able to buy everything I want abroad without a second thought! :)

I used the ExchangeRate API (https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) for currency conversion and mixed in a bunch of stuff I learned in class. IM VERY SATISFIED THAT EVERYTHING LINED UP WITH MY VISION FOR THIS APP, despite struggling with something I had no in-depth knowledge about. AND I cannot wait to use this for my future travels as well. :)
